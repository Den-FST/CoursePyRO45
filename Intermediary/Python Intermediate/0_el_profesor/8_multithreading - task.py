1. Numbers divided by x
	a. create a function that counts how many numbers can be divided by 3 from 1 to n
	b. create a function that counts how many numbers can be divided by 7 from 1 to n
	c. create THREADS to run all 3 functions at the same time
	d. create PROCESSES to run all 3 function at the same time
	e. create a function that counts how many numbers are palindrom from 1 to n (121, 1234321)

2. run each point(a, b, c) from ex.2(iterators and generators) using:
	a. threads
	b. processes
